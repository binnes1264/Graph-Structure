# Graph-Structure

Instructions:

Read the adjacency list of an undirected graph from a text file called "graph.txt".
The edge weights are 1.
the node IDs are integers.
For example, with the following graph, the file will contain the following information (similar to Assignment 3)

1 2 3
2 4 5
3 5
4 5

Create a graph similar to your tree in Assignment 3 but this time using GraphStream.
Note that there is no root in a graph.
If there is an edge between nodes a and b, do not add a new edge for nodes b and a.
Display the graph.
